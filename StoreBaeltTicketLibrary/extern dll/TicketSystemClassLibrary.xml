            Vehicle is an abstract class so we can use it in the future for different types of vehicles, but we can't make objects out of it
            
            Objects that inherit from the Vehicle class have the following properties:
            string LicensePlace
            DateTime Date
            bool BroBizz
            
            Vehicle objects have two methods: 
            Price() which returns a double of the price of a ticket for that vehicletype. Remember to include brobizz discount if relevant
            VehicleType() which returns a string of the type of vehicle the ticket is for.
